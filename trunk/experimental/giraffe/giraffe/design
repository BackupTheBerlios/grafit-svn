Project:
    container, encapsulates a metakit database
    has a flat structure, may contain several types of Items, each type corresponds to a view

item = Item(project)

We should never hold references to items or item names, only to item.id
and use project.get(id). These references are guaranteed to be 
valid even after saving/loading the project or deleting/undeleting the item.


Item:
    always associated with a Project
    data is stored in a row of a metakit view in a Project
    identified by uuid, (self.id)

    

Folders and paths:
    Folders are implemented as a type of Item.
    folder[name:S,id:S,parent:S]
    item[name:S,id:S,parent:S,other_data...]

    Paths: project.get(path)

    project.get('/pis-0/e1_f')
    pis0 = Folder(proj, 'pis-0')
    data = Folder(proj, 'data', pis0)

    or...
    
    project.mkfolder('/pis-0')
    project.mkfolder('/pis-0/e1_f')

    project.rmfolder('/pis-0')
    project.cd('/')
